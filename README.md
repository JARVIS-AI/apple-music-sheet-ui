# Apple Music Sheet UI Demo with Expo

This project demonstrates an implementation of the Apple Music player UI in React Native using Expo, with a focus on replicating the smooth sheet transitions and scaling animations.

## Features

- ðŸŽµ Full-screen music player modal with gesture controls
- ðŸ”„ Smooth scaling animations of the root content
- ðŸ‘† Interactive pan gesture handling
- ðŸ“± iOS-style sheet presentation
- ðŸŽ¨ Dynamic border radius animations

## Tech Stack

- [Expo](https://expo.dev) - React Native development platform
- [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction) - File-based routing
- [React Native Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/) - Smooth animations
- [React Native Gesture Handler](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/) - Native-driven gesture handling

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

3. Open in iOS Simulator or Android Emulator:
